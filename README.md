## Disclaimer and Warning

The authors (Spoonail and the contributors) take no responsibility for any consequences resulting from the use of this
software.

Currently, Creator of Another World does not have an official modding API, so all mods are unofficial and fan-made
content.  
Please refrain from asking questions about modding on directly to the original game's author.

It is recommended to create a backup of your saves and game files before installing 'maginai' or any mods.

'maginai' will execute any code introduced as a mod.  
It is the user's responsibility to verify the safety of each mod.
